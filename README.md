# sc-sn-RNA-seq-pre-processing

Now considering that the emergence of scRNA-seq techniques provides the framework to study gene expression variability in tissue of interest, the pre-processing of high dimensional RNA-seq data also becomes an important topic. To this day, droplet-based technologies remain the technique of choice when it comes to capturing and sequencing a large number of individual cells. This method essentially barcodes single cells and tags each transcript with a unique molecular identifier (UMI) within individual droplets, which can significantly increase the throughput up to 10,000 cells per analysis. However, this technique is not free of noise, and one must carefully pre-process the data before any unbiased downstream analysis can be caried out.
